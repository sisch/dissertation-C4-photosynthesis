What did I do so far?

programming and data
\begin{itemize}
	\item Custom Analysis pipelines
	\item Evaluation of \foreignword{de novo} Assembly Software with 454 data
	\item Evaluation of Assembly Software with Illumina data
	\item Chimeric contig detection
	\item Comparison of public datasets from different sources by complexity reduction
\end{itemize}

metabolism
\begin{itemize}
	\item \species{Megathyrsus maximus} PEP-CK type C$_4$
	\item \species{Megathyrsus} blueprint for engineering C$_4$-cycle
\end{itemize}
	
transport
\begin{itemize}
	\item \species{Megathyrsus} intercellular transport requirement
	\item \species{Megathyrsus} modular intracellular transport machinery
\end{itemize}



%%%PLAYGROUND. To be deleted in the final version
\subsection{Custom analysis pipelines}
this one is very generic so I will fit it in somewhere in between
\subsection{Evaluation of assembly softwares}
For de novo assembly of 454 pyrosequencing reads we tested six different assembly algorithms with simulated reads. These reads were extracted from the \species{Arabidopsis} genome and were therefore considered as perfect reads. To get a more realistic picture of assembly we additionally modified the reads with 1\%/3\%/5\% \foreignword{in silico} base changes.
